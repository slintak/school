==  Basic Info  ==

This project implements run-length encoding (RLE) in C language. It was one of
my project in university course 'Introduction to Programming Systems'.

To compile and run, just clone this repository and run 'make decode'. Code is
using C99 standard and I tested it with GCC (4.2.1).

== Example ==

For coding text, just type:

	./proj1 -c 1 < in.txt.cs

For decode, use:

	./proj1 -d 1 < out.txt.cs

Input and output of application is stdin and stdout, so you can use even Unix
pipes:

	echo "aaaaaaa bbb ccd" | ./proj1 -c 1
