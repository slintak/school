== Basic Info ==

Another university project in course 'Introduction to Programming Systems'.
This one implements matrices -- adding, multiplying and searching for bubbles.

== Examples ==

For add two matrices:

	./proj3 --vadd txt/a.txt txt/b.txt

Multiply matrices:

	./proj3 --mmult txt/mul_a.txt txt/mul_b.txt

And for bubbles searching (matrix is slice through some material, where
zero represents air bubble and non-zero number represents material, algorthm
counts number of bubbles):

	./proj3 --bubbles txt/bubbles.txt	# 5 bubbles

and bubbles in vector of matrices:

	./proj3 --extbubbles txt/bubbles_3D.tx	# 3 bubbles

If you want to test multiplying big matrices (i.e. file with >100MB), just
run ./txt/gen.awk with AWK and run:

	./proj3 --mmult txt/big.txt txt/matrix.txt
